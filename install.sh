# scaffolding — bootstrap shim.
#
# Ensures `uv` is available, then runs the scaffolding CLI straight from git
# (no PyPI). All real work lives in the Python package; this shim only exists to
# preserve the documented one-liner and to bootstrap uv on a cold machine:
#
#   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collectiveai-team/scaffolding/main/install.sh | bash
#
# Anything after `--` (or any args) is forwarded to `scaffolding install`, e.g.:
#
#   curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash -s -- --yes
#   curl -fsSL .../install.sh | bash -s -- ci prek --ci-parts tests,security
#
# Override the source ref with SCAFFOLDING_REF (default: main).
