Personal repo bootstrap + agent skills for opencode / claude-code / codex.

This repo does two things:

1. **Bootstrap a repo** with my workspace defaults (gitignore, per-agent config,
   `AGENTS.md` guidance, optional prek hooks, ast-grep, CI, Varlock secrets) via a
   small Python CLI. This is a one-time-per-repo operation, run as an *agentic
   install* or directly — not an installed skill. Target one or more agents with
   `--agent` (repeatable / comma-separated; default `opencode`).
2. **Ship a couple of recurring skills** (`journalist`, `handoff`) that you
   install once and use repeatedly.

Most engineering workflow skills I use come from Matt Pocock's
[`skills`](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills). This repo intentionally does
not vendor those; it only contains my own additions.

## Bootstrap a repo

Run this from the root of the repo you want to set up.

**Existing working repo (recommended): let an agent do it.** The bootstrap needs
judgment — new-vs-existing detection, additive JSONC/`AGENTS.md` merges, Python
detection, and per-item conflict resolution. The CLI does the deterministic
clean-adds; the agent drives it and handles merges. Point your agent at the guide:

> Set up this repo by following the instructions here:
> `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collectiveai-team/scaffolding/main/guide.md`
> Don't summarize it — follow every step.

**New / empty repo (fast path): run the CLI directly.** It does clean adds only
and refuses to touch existing files, deferring any merge to the agent.

Straight from git via `uvx` (no PyPI):

```bash
uvx --from git+https://github.com/collectiveai-team/scaffolding scaffolding install
```

Or via the bootstrap shim (also installs `uv` if missing — preserves the classic
one-liner):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/collectiveai-team/scaffolding/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer is idempotent — safe to re-run. Existing files are never edited or
overwritten; they are reported as `[defer]` for the agent to merge.

### Commands

```
scaffolding install [components…]   # clean-adds (all default-on, or just the named ones)
scaffolding install --yes           # non-interactive / CI (conservative defaults)
scaffolding install --dry-run       # render the plan, write nothing
scaffolding plan --json             # machine-readable plan for the agent path
scaffolding list                    # available components (gate / default / what they add)
scaffolding check                   # verify bootstrap completeness (nonzero exit on failure)
scaffolding doctor                  # diagnose environment + tools
```

Components: `gitignore agent-config prek ast-grep pyproject ci agents standards
skills varlock` (all default-on except `ci`, which is opt-in). Scope with
positional names or `--skip a,b`. Useful flags: `--agent` (repeatable:
`opencode`/`claude-code`/`codex`), `--ci/--no-ci`, `--ci-parts`,
`--name`, `--description`, `--varlock/--no-varlock`, `--no-deps`. Legacy env vars
(`AGENT`, `SKIP_SKILLS`, `SKIP_VARLOCK`, `WITH_CI`/`SKIP_CI`, `ASSUME_YES`) are
honored.

There is no `uninstall`: the installer requires a git repo, so `git status` /
`git checkout` / `git clean` are the undo mechanism.

## Installed skills

These are real skills you install once and use repeatedly. They land in the
shared `.agents/skills` standard (read by opencode + codex); selecting
`claude-code` bridges them via the `.claude/skills` → `.agents/skills` symlink.

Which skills a repo uses is declared in **`skills-lock.json`, the tracked skills
manifest** (CES-107). `.agents/skills/` is derived from it and stays gitignored.
`scaffolding install` restores from the manifest rather than re-fetching a
hardcoded list:

```bash
npx skills experimental_install
```

Think `pyproject.toml` / `uv.lock`: the baseline below is the declared intent,
`skills-lock.json` is the resolved set, `.agents/skills/` is the `.venv`. The
analogy stops at the guarantee. Entries carry a `ref` only when the source was
pinned (`owner/repo#v1.2.3`), tags are mutable, and the `computedHash` that is
written is never verified on restore. So it reproduces *which skills, from where,
at what ref* — not bytes. It is a manifest, not a lock.

The `skills` CLI owns the file; scaffolding reads it and never writes it. Adding a
skill is `npx skills add`, which records the source, ref and hash actually used.

Two states, and one refusal. A repo **with** a manifest restores from it — it is
the source of truth, and is never topped up towards the house baseline, so a skill
you removed stays removed. A repo **without** one gets the baseline seeded, which
creates it. A manifest that exists but does not parse is deferred, never
overwritten. If the manifest is gitignored, install offers to un-ignore it — the
one consent this asks for, since it is the one file the repo owns that scaffolding
edits.

Skills install once into `.agents/skills`; claude-code reaches them via the
`.claude/skills` symlink created by the bootstrap, so there is no need to re-run
the installer with `--agent claude-code` / `--agent codex`.

### Working with skills

| Situation | What to run |
| --- | --- |
| New repo | `scaffolding install`, then commit `skills-lock.json` |
| Existing repo, first adoption | `scaffolding install`, accept the un-ignore prompt, commit |
| Fresh clone / CI | `scaffolding install` (or `npx skills experimental_install`) |
| Add a skill | `npx skills add <source> --agent opencode --yes --skill <name>`, commit |
| Remove a skill | delete the directory **and** the manifest entry, `scaffolding check`, commit |
| Skills installed, no manifest | `scaffolding install`, then read the warnings — see below |

`components.py` is not part of any of these. It is the baseline for repos that have
no manifest yet; changing a repo's skill set is always `npx skills`, and the CLI
records the source, ref and hash it used.

#### Skills installed, but no manifest

The common migration case. Provenance is **not recoverable from disk**: an
installed skill directory holds only `SKILL.md`, and with no manifest
`skills list --json` reports `source: null`. So nothing is adopted or guessed —
the baseline is seeded and install warns about both hazards before it runs:

```
[warn] skills-lock.json: our-private-skill
       installed but not in the house baseline, and its source cannot be
       recovered from disk — run `npx skills add <source> --skill our-private-skill`
[warn] .agents/skills/tdd
       already on disk and will be replaced by the seed — if it was edited by
       hand, copy it out first; the derived tree is gitignored, so there is no
       diff to recover it from
```

Afterwards `scaffolding check` names exactly what is left:

```
FAIL  installed skills declared  in .agents/skills but not in skills-lock.json:
                                 our-private-skill
```

Declare it with its real source, or delete the directory. Either way the manifest
and the tree end up agreeing, which is what the check enforces.

#### Removing a skill

`npx skills remove` **does not work** for projects using `.agents/skills/`. That
directory is shared by ~15 agents, and the CLI keeps both the files and the
manifest entry while any other detected agent still references the skill
(`src/remove.ts:262-302`), so the command reports success and changes nothing.
`--agent '*'` is documented but rejected at runtime. Until that is fixed upstream,
remove by hand:

```bash
rm -rf .agents/skills/<name>
# delete the "<name>" entry from skills-lock.json
scaffolding check    # fails if you did only one of the two
git add -A && git commit
```

`scaffolding check` compares the manifest and the tree in both directions
precisely so a half-finished removal cannot pass silently. Because the baseline is
never re-applied, a removed skill stays removed.

To seed by hand instead of running the CLI:

```bash
npx skills add mattpocock/skills --agent opencode --yes --skill grill-with-docs triage improve-codebase-architecture setup-matt-pocock-skills to-spec to-tickets implement wayfinder prototype diagnosing-bugs research tdd domain-modeling codebase-design code-review resolving-merge-conflicts grill-me teach writing-great-skills grilling
npx skills add collectiveai-team/scaffolding --agent opencode --yes --skill ask-user journalist handoff test-smell-review
npx skills add dmno-dev/varlock --agent opencode --yes
```

## What's in this repo

- `scaffolding/` — the bootstrap CLI (Cyclopts + Questionary + pydantic-settings
  + Rich). `cli.py`, `engine.py`/`plan.py`, `components.py`, and `templates/`
  (per-agent config — opencode.jsonc / .claude settings, prek hooks, pyproject,
  ast-grep rules, CI workflows, AGENTS.md section).
- `install.sh` — thin bootstrap shim (ensure `uv`, then run the CLI from git).
- `guide.md` — the agentic-install guide (judgment layer).
- `skills/productivity/journalist` — local daily session journals under `.journals/`.
- `skills/productivity/handoff` — compact the current session into a temp-dir handoff for another agent.
- `skills/productivity/ask-user` — route a situation to the smallest suitable installed workflow.
- `skills/quality/test-smell-review` — review tests for false-green smells (pass without
  protecting anything) using an in-context judgment protocol, adapted from
  `falsegreen-skill` without its external LLM-CLI dependency.
- `docs/engineering-standards.md` — **CES (Collective Engineering Standard)**: how house
  rules are coded, cited (`CES-<issue#>` + slug), and shipped. Single source of truth,
  referenced by `AGENTS.md`.
