"""Derive a proposal's review state from reviewer votes recorded as issue comments.

`state:approved` and `state:declined` are DERIVED: no human and no model writes them
(see the `PROTECTED` guards in `.github/workflows/proposal-update.yml`). They are the
output of this tally, whose only input is the comment ledger of the issue.

The tally is **stateless** — every run replays the whole ledger from the last reset
marker, so a missed webhook, a hand-edited label, or a re-run all converge on the same
answer. Labels are a derived mirror for the board, never the source of truth.

Ledger rules:

- A vote is a comment whose line starts with `/approve`, `/object`, `/decline` or
  `/withdraw`.
- **One vote per account.** Votes reduce to a map keyed by login and the account's
  LAST command wins, so re-voting replaces rather than accumulates.
- Only accounts with write access to the repo are counted, checked per-login and
  failing closed. The repo is public, so anyone can type `/approve`.
- Comments before the newest reset marker are ignored: revising the body dismisses
  approvals (they were cast against text that no longer exists).
- An objection is sticky — a revision does NOT clear it, only the objector's
  `/withdraw` does. Otherwise an author lifts objections by editing.
- Silence can approve (lazy consensus) but never decline.
- `state:declined` is terminal and `state:had-comments` survives an empty ledger:
  an approval must be earned, a block is preserved.
