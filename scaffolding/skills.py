"""Skills manifest — CES-107.

``skills-lock.json`` is the tracked declaration of a repo's agent skills; the
``.agents/skills/`` tree is *derived* from it and is never the source of truth.
This is the ``pyproject.toml`` / ``uv.lock`` split, with the house baseline below
playing the role of the declared intent and the lock file the resolved set.

**The `skills` CLI owns this file. We read it; we never write it.** That is the
central constraint of this module, and it is not stylistic. The upstream schema
(``vercel-labs/skills``, ``src/local-lock.ts``) carries ``ref``, ``skillPath`` and
``computedHash`` per entry, and its own comments explain the cost of losing them:

    /** Path to the skill's SKILL.md within the source repo.
     *  Required to re-install only this skill on update — without it, an update
     *  would refetch every skill in the source repo. */

Re-serialising the file from a narrower Python model silently drops those fields.
The same source is explicit that the file is ours to commit:

    /** This file is meant to be checked into version control. */

What the lock does and does not buy, measured against ``skills@1.5.22`` rather
than assumed:

- ``ref`` records the branch or tag used at install time, and only when the source
  was pinned (``owner/repo#v1.2.3``). Tags are mutable, so this is tag-level, not
  commit-level, reproducibility.
- ``computedHash`` is written on ``add`` and compared only in ``sync.ts`` on the
  ``experimental_sync``/node_modules path. Restore never verifies it. There is no
  integrity guarantee.

So: reproducible in *which skills, from where, at what ref*. Not byte-reproducible.
Say that, and do not call it a lock in the ``uv.lock`` sense.

This module takes primitives rather than a ``Context`` so that it stays below
``components`` in the import order (CES-5) and is testable through its own seam.
